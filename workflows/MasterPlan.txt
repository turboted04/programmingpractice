/**
 * YOUR MASTER PLAN: Programming + IT Learning (Semester + Winter Break)
 * 
 * REALISTIC. FOCUSED. PRACTICAL.
 * 
 * Two parallel tracks that converge during winter break.
 */

// ============================================
// THE CORE PRINCIPLE
// ============================================

RIGHT NOW (Semester - 5 weeks):
- Programming: Stay sharp, support your classes
- IT Research: Build knowledge base (broad, conceptual)
- Goal: Pass classes, understand fundamentals

WINTER BREAK (4 weeks):
- Programming: Build real projects
- IT: Apply knowledge in homelab
- Goal: Portfolio pieces, hands-on experience


// ============================================
// WEEKLY SCHEDULE (During Semester)
// ============================================

MONDAY (20-30 min) - Java Practice
├─ Do one problem from DailyArrayPractice.java
├─ Test it thoroughly
└─ This keeps your fundamentals sharp

WEDNESDAY (20-30 min) - JavaScript Translation
├─ Take Monday's Java solution
├─ Rewrite it in JavaScript
├─ See the parallels between languages
└─ This directly helps your web dev class

FRIDAY (30-45 min) - Bridge Project Work
├─ Build ONE feature that uses both
├─ Could be for class assignment or personal
├─ Example: Add search to a class project (uses array filtering)
└─ This shows you where skills connect

TUESDAY (30 min) - IT Research (Concepts)
├─ Read/watch about ONE topic
├─ Take notes in your own words
├─ Don't worry about hands-on yet
└─ Topics below

THURSDAY (30 min) - IT Research (Application)
├─ Learn how Tuesday's topic is used in real world
├─ Watch tutorials or read case studies
├─ Think: "How would this help my projects?"
└─ Build mental models

WEEKEND:
├─ Class homework (priority!)
├─ Catch up on anything you missed
└─ If extra time: tinker with Linux VM (optional, low pressure)

// ============================================
// RESOURCES (Curated, Not Overwhelming)
// ============================================

PROGRAMMING:
├─ Your DailyArrayPractice.java file ← Start here
├─ MDN Web Docs (for JavaScript)
├─ freeCodeCamp (for web dev practice)
└─ LeetCode Easy (when you're ready)

IT CONCEPTS:
├─ NetworkChuck (YouTube - entertaining, informative)
├─ TechWorld with Nana (YouTube - clear tutorials)
├─ "How Linux Works" by Brian Ward (book - deeper reading)
└─ Professor Messer (for structured learning)

WHEN YOU START HOMELAB:
├─ r/homelab wiki (great starter guides)
├─ LinuxJourney.com (interactive Linux learning)
├─ Docker documentation "Get Started"
└─ DigitalOcean tutorials (excellent quality)

RULE: Use 2-3 resources MAX per topic. Don't collect tutorials.


// ============================================
// PROJECT PROGRESSION (Bridge Projects)
// ============================================

Projects to build in order (connects everything):

1. GRADE CALCULATOR ← Perfect for end of semester
   Java/JS: Calculate GPA, averages, predictions
   Web: Form inputs, results display
   Homelab: Deploy to your server (winter)

2. TODO LIST WITH SMART FEATURES
   Java/JS: Filter, sort, search algorithms
   Web: Interactive UI, state management
   Homelab: Add database, containerize

3. PERSONAL DASHBOARD
   Java/JS: System info, log parsing, stats
   Web: Real-time updates, charts
   Homelab: Monitor your services

Each project uses MORE of what you know.
Each project is portfolio-worthy.


// ============================================
// TRACKING PROGRESS
// ============================================

Keep a simple log (text file is fine):

WEEK 1:
[✓] Mon: Solved second largest problem
[✓] Tue: Learned about Linux file systems
[✓] Wed: Translated to JavaScript
[ ] Thu: Read about networking
[✓] Fri: Added search to class project

This shows progress and helps you stay consistent.


// ============================================
// THE MINDSET
// ============================================

SEMESTER (Now - 5 weeks):
├─ "I'm building foundations"
├─ Stay consistent, not perfect
├─ Class homework comes first
├─ Programming practice stays sharp
└─ IT knowledge accumulates quietly

WINTER BREAK (4 weeks):
├─ "I'm applying everything"
├─ Go deeper, build real things
├─ Connect all the dots
├─ Create portfolio pieces
└─ Have fun with it!

SPRING SEMESTER (Future):
├─ You'll be ahead in classes
├─ You'll have real projects to show
├─ You'll understand full-stack + infrastructure
└─ Internship applications will be strong


// ============================================
// KEY PRINCIPLES
// ============================================

1. CONSISTENCY > INTENSITY
   Better: 30 min daily for 5 weeks
   Worse: 5 hours once per week

2. APPLICATION > THEORY
   Don't just learn - BUILD something with it
   Every concept should lead to a project

3. BREADTH NOW, DEPTH LATER
   Semester: Learn concepts broadly
   Winter: Deep dive on specific skills

4. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING
   Write READMEs, take notes, screenshot projects
   Future you will thank present you

5. ONE THING AT A TIME
   If class is busy, skip Friday's practice
   If IT concept is unclear, watch another video
   Adjust without guilt


// ============================================
// SUCCESS METRICS
// ============================================

BY END OF SEMESTER:
□ Solved 10+ Java algorithm problems
□ Can translate Java logic to JavaScript
□ Completed 1-2 bridge projects
□ Understand core IT concepts (OS, networking, servers, databases)
□ Ready to start homelab

BY END OF WINTER BREAK:
□ Working homelab with 2-3 deployed projects
□ Comfortable with Linux command line
□ Can use Docker for deployments
□ 1 major portfolio project (dashboard)
□ Resume/LinkedIn updated with real projects
□ Can talk confidently about your infrastructure

This is realistic and achievable.


// ============================================
// WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW
// ============================================

TODAY:
1. Review your DailyArrayPractice.java file
2. Solve Day 1: secondLargest
3. Test it with different arrays
4. Done. That's your start.

THIS WEEK:
Mon: Day 1 problem
Tue: Watch NetworkChuck video on "What is Linux?"
Wed: Translate Day 1 to JavaScript
Thu: Read about how the internet works
Fri: Add a sorting feature to any class project

JUST START.
The momentum builds from there.


// ============================================
// FINAL THOUGHTS
// ============================================

You have:
✓ Clear daily structure (M/W/F code, T/Th research)
✓ Focused programming track (Java → JS + bridges)
✓ Conceptual IT learning (no pressure to practice yet)
✓ Winter break plan (apply everything hands-on)
✓ Portfolio trajectory (real deployed projects)

This is the path.
Simple. Achievable. Career-building.

You don't need to do everything.
You need to do THIS, consistently.

Let's go.
